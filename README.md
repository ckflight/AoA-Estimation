# AoA Estimation with bladeRF 2.0 Micro 2RX Channel and HackRF Signal Source

This project implements **Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation** using two receiving channels of a bladeRF 2.0 Micro SDR device. The signal source is generated by a HackRF device, and the processing and visualization are handled in Python.

## Overview

- **Hardware Setup:**
  - **Receiver:** bladeRF 2.0 Micro (2RX channels)
  - **Transmitter:** HackRF SDR
- **Signal Frequency:** ~800 MHz
- **Purpose:** Estimate the AoA based on phase difference between two antennas spaced 10 cm apart.
- **Data Handling:**
  - Real-time data streaming and plotting via ZeroMQ (ZMQ) sockets from GNU Radio.
  - Offline analysis from recorded `.dat` files.
- **Python Scripts:**
  - `live_zmq_plot.py`: Subscribes to ZMQ data feed and plots live histograms of phase difference, arcsin argument, and AoA estimate.
  - (Another script) to plot AoA from recorded `.dat` files.

## Theory

The AoA is estimated by calculating the phase difference of the received signal at two spatially separated antennas. Given the antenna spacing `d`, the signal wavelength `λ`, and the measured phase difference `Δφ`, the AoA `θ` is estimated as:

\[
\theta = \arcsin \left( \frac{\Delta \phi \cdot \lambda}{2 \pi d} \right)
\]
